                About Me
            </h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jacqueline Barranco and this is my 3rd year at Mesa College. My major is Communications. I
                come from a family of six; 3 older sisters, my mom, and dad. I am born and raised in San Diego and have only
                been outside of the U.S. once.</p>

            <p>My favorite comfort food is Mexican and Korean food!</p>

            <p>I am taking WEBD 152 because I recently had an interest of having my own website and after seeing that there
                were no special templates that I liked, I wanted to make my own, but I am not very knowledgable in that area
                yet, so I wanted to try to learn web design.</p>
