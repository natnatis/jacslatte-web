    <h1>
        Final Project Proposal
    </h1>
<p>My website will be a daily blog. My website will cover fashion, beauty, food, current favorites, and morning/night routines, etc. I've always wanted to create a lifestyle website where I am able to express myself and write about some of my favorites things. The purpose of my website is to be able to write down daily things that happen in my day/night for others to read to spark ideas for their own personal lives or for pure entertainment.</p>

<p>The primary audience for my website will be people who find my content most helpful or entertaining. There could be people who enjoy reading about my day but there will also be others who are looking for inspiration. When they interact with my website, they should know that this is purely my daily life, there is nothing grand about it but it is something that I am interested in, so I like to share it with others. The type of content that my website will have is fashion, home, beauty, current favorites, and my routines. I will monitor my days and either film/write down notes and then fully write it out once I'm ready to write a blog post and share it on my website. I will do my best to not use any other people's work, such as pinning photos onto my posts. I will need to prepare for my content, so I fully know how I will be writing things and what pictures I will be posting. If others are collaborating with me and/or helping me, a timely schedule delivery will be told to everyone.</p>

<p>I chose this topic because I am always looking for inspiration and entertainment from others, so I want to try and do my own!</p>
