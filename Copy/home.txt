Hello World!

My name is Jacqueline Barranco. I am a student in WEBD 152: Beginning HTML and CSS. My purpose for creating this web site is to practice coding HTML and CSS to create a simple 3-page web site as part of WEBD 152. This class assignment web site will help me to design and build my final project web site.

The primary audience for this web site is the Fall 2019 online 8-week WEBD 152 class. After using this web site, the audience will know about my proposed Final Project, and a little bit about me. 

Please visit again later this semester as this assignment web site is developed!
